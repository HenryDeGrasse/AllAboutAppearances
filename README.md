#AllAboutAppearances
You caught me! This repo uses Python and tkcalendar to backdate Git commits, turning my GitHub contribution graph into a sea of green squares. Because apparently, those little pixels are the ultimate measure of coding cred—eye roll.
##Why?
To poke fun at the absurdity of judging talent by a commit heatmap. This script lets you pick dates with a tkcalendar GUI and fake commits to look like you coded through the ages.
##Setup

Using python3.9 or later, (set up venv if needed) 
Install: pip install -r requirements.txt
Run: python gitcheat.py
Pick dates, push, and watch the squares glow.

Note
Green squares don’t code. People do. Use this for laughs, not lies. MIT License.
